# 📊 Sentiment Analysis using Classical Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on textual data using a range of classical machine learning algorithms. We use **text preprocessing techniques**, **Bag of Words (BoW)** for feature extraction, and train models like **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Tree**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify sentiments as positive or negative.

## 📌 Objective

To build a sentiment classification model that accurately predicts the sentiment (e.g., positive or negative) of input text data using various machine learning techniques.


## 🧪 Algorithms Used

- ✅ Logistic Regression
- ✅ Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
- ✅ Decision Tree Classifier
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧠 NLP Techniques

- Text preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing
  - Punctuation removal
  - Stopword removal
  - Tokenization
- Text vectorization using:
  - **Bag of Words (BoW)** model via `CountVectorizer`

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankitkumar1141/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
cd Machine-Learning-Projects/sentiment-analysis


pip install -r requirements.txt

### Follow the step-by-step code to:

Load and clean the data

Perform text vectorization using BoW

Train and evaluate multiple models

Compare accuracy and other performance metrics

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate models using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Sample Output
Each model's performance is compared, and the best-performing model is identified based on accuracy and generalization capability on test data.

## 📚 Dataset
You can use any public sentiment dataset such as:
