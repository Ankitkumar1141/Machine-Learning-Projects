# üß¨ Tumor Classification Using Ensemble Techniques

This project involves classifying tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using ensemble machine learning methods. The dataset, along with its detailed description, can be found in the `./data' file.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

The task is to build models that can classify patient tumors as either **malignant** or **benign** based on clinical features. The key objective is to explore and compare different **ensemble learning techniques** and evaluate their effectiveness on the classification task.

## ‚úÖ Exercise Objectives

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Create training and testing sets.
3. Preprocess and normalize the features.
4. Implement the following ensemble methods with default settings:
   - **Bagging (Random Forest)**
   - **AdaBoost**
   - **Gradient Boosting**
   - **XGBoost**
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning to select the best configuration for each model.
6. Compare model performances and summarize findings.
7. (Optional) Plot decision boundaries for visualization.

## üß† Ensemble Learning Techniques Overview

### 1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)

Bagging involves training multiple models (often decision trees) on random subsets of the data and aggregating their predictions.

- **Pros:**
  - Reduces overfitting and variance
  - Simple to implement
  - Generally performs better than individual models

- **Cons:**
  - Does not reduce model bias
  - Can be computationally intensive
  - Averaging predictions may lose nuance

> üí° *Hint:* Start by training a base classifier (e.g., Decision Tree). Use `BalancedBaggingClassifier` from `imblearn.ensemble` to build a balanced bagging ensemble.

---

### 2. Boosting

Boosting sequentially trains models, where each new model focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous ones.

- **Pros:**
  - Builds strong models from weak learners
  - Reduces bias and underfitting

- **Cons:**
  - Prone to overfitting if not tuned properly
  - More computationally expensive than bagging

---

### 3. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)

AdaBoost combines multiple weak classifiers (typically shallow decision trees) by focusing more on misclassified examples with each iteration. It aims to minimize **exponential loss**.

- **Pros:**
  - High accuracy with minimal tuning
  - Elegant and interpretable boosting method

- **Cons:**
  - Sensitive to noisy data
  - Fixed loss function

> üí° *Hint:* Use `AdaBoostClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble` with `n_estimators` to control the number of weak learners.

---

### 4. Gradient Boosting

An extension of AdaBoost that allows custom loss functions and more robust error correction.

- **Pros:**
  - Flexible loss function
  - Often yields better performance than AdaBoost

- **Cons:**
  - Sensitive to overfitting
  - Slower training time compared to simpler methods

---

### 5. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

An optimized version of Gradient Boosting that includes **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization to control overfitting. It also supports:

- Parallel computation
- Out-of-core learning
- Cache-aware optimization

---

### 6. Stacking

Stacking combines multiple base models and trains a meta-model on their predictions to make the final decision.

- **Pros:**
  - Can capture a broader range of model behaviors
  - Often achieves high accuracy

- **Cons:**
  - Reduces available training data due to split for meta-model
  - More complex to implement and tune

---

## üñºÔ∏è Bonus: Decision Boundary Visualization

As an optional task, try plotting decision boundaries for your classifiers. While the tumor dataset may not produce very distinct visual boundaries, you can experiment with the `make_moons` dataset from `sklearn.datasets` to visualize decision regions more clearly.

---

## üìù Summary

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand the differences between bagging and boosting techniques
- Implement and tune multiple ensemble models
- Compare model performance on real-world classification data
- Visualize the impact of ensemble methods on decision boundaries
